It was fairly simple to get all of the trophies and achievements in the first game, as the process to do so was generally uncomplicated. The same can be said for The Cosmic Shake, so let’s take a look at all the trophies you can snatch up, and examine how difficult they are to obtain.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false><strong>Warning: The following guide contains spoilers for </strong><strong>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake.</strong></p><h2 id=h-spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-trophy-guide data-injectable=false>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake – Trophy Guide</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Awards-in-SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake.jpg><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=918 data-injectable=true>To earn the glorious Platinum Trophy in The Cosmic Shake, you’ll need to earn a total of 43 trophies. These vary in difficulty, but most of them will come naturally as users play through the game. You shouldn’t need a list of all the available trophies, as they are listed under the Awards section in the game’s menu, but a large amount of the Awards are locked at the outset of The Cosmic Shake gameplay. With this in mind, here’s what you’ll need to look out for as you play through the main story.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>It’s worth noting that there are no missable trophies — you can backtrack for each one. The Awards menu also tracks your progress in certain requirements that contribute to obtaining various trophies, so it is worth checking periodically if you are stuck. The following list details the trophies included in The Cosmic Shake, with names, grades, and descriptions, along with some instructions on what to do if you are having trouble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Band-Geeks-Uniform-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-JellyBob-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Dried-Sponge-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-RoboBob-SteelPants-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-MermaidManBob-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Employee-of-the-Month-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Underwear-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-PrimitiveBob-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Flower-Costume.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Bard-Costume.jpg><ul data-current-count=2133 data-injectable=true><li><strong>“Dress Up – Bronze – Unlock your first costume.”</strong> This one is story-related, you will unlock it at the beginning of the game.</li><li><strong>“Deputy – Bronze – Complete all main missions in the Wild West Jellyfish Fields.”</strong> Simply beat the first level and this trophy is yours.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>“Movie Star – Bronze – Complete all main missions in Karate Downtown Bikini Bottom.”</strong> All you have to do is beat the second level to get this trophy.</li><li><strong>“First Mate – Bronze – Complete all main missions in Pirate Goo Lagoon.”</strong> Just beat the third level to get this Bronze Trophy.</li><li><strong>“Scardypants – Bronze – Complete all main missions in Halloween Rock Bottom.”</strong> The fourth level is the one you need to beat to earn “Scardypants.”</li><li><strong>“Ugh Ugaha! – Bronze – Complete all main missions in Prehistoric Kelp Forest.”</strong> You need to beat the fifth level of the game to earn this trophy.</li><li><strong>“King of the Castle – Bronze – Complete all main missions in Medieval Sulfur Fields.”</strong> Beat the sixth level of the game and you will earn “King of the Castle.”</li><li><strong>“Ride Rider – Bronze – Complete all main missions in Jelly Glove World.”</strong> Finish the last level of the game to earn “Ride Rider.”</li><li><strong>“Local Hero – Silver – Save Bikini Bottom from being destroyed.”</strong> Once you beat the game by defeating the final boss, you will receive this Silver Trophy.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Burrower.jpg><ul data-current-count=4608 data-injectable=true><li><strong>“Volley King – Bronze – Defeat 10 Baby Booms by reflecting their missile.”</strong> You will encounter an enemy called a Baby Boom in Pirate Goo Lagoon that will throw Jelly Missiles at you. If you use your Spin Attack as the missile comes close to SpongeBob, you will send it flying back in their direction. The enemy has two pieces of health, and this attack is integral to defeating them, so either do this twice in a row or inflict damage first to earn this trophy.</li><li><strong>“Jaws with Flaws – Bronze – Defeat 10 enemies with the Burrower.”</strong> The Burrower is an enemy introduced in Prehistoric Kelp Forest. It rumbles underground before attacking, and if it launches while enemies are above it, those enemies will be defeated and contribute to the trophy.</li><li><strong>“Wrath-Tub – Bronze – Defeat 25 enemies with the Big Jelly’s attack.”</strong> The Big Jelly is an enemy you will encounter that uses a bathtub as a weapon. As it swings the tub it will also hit the enemies around you, so it’s helpful to leave smaller enemies alone and draw them into the attack to snatch up this trophy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>“The Good, the Bad and the Krabby – Silver – Catch Mr. Krabs in under 3 minutes.”</strong> This trophy can be earned during the boss fight for the Wild West Jellyfish Fields. Once on the train, you’ll have three minutes to get to the end of the level if you want to add it to your trophy chest. This particular trophy is much easier to obtain once you’ve completed the level once and earned the Karate Kick ability, however, so we recommend playing the level through before making an attempt.</li><li><strong>“Kah-Rah-Tay King – Silver – Don’t take damage during the Sandy boss fight.”</strong> This might be the hardest trophy in the game. After a bit of trial and error, you’ll be able to figure out how to avoid taking a hit during the boss fight for Karate Downtown Bikini Bottom. The first time Sandy goes into her saw formation, however, it is quite hard to avoid taking a hit. What you want to do is strafe back and to either the right or left to avoid her just after the cutscene concludes. Then, jump and dodge when she gets close.</li><li><strong>“Deck Scrubber – Silver – Reclaim the Dutchman’s ship within 5 minutes during the boss fight.”</strong> This is one of the easiest boss fight trophies, just take out the enemies as quickly as possible at the end of Pirate Goo Lagoon.</li><li><strong>“Pet You Didn’t See That Coming – Silver – Don’t get seen by King Gary during the boss fight.”</strong> During the Halloween Rock Bottom boss fight, Gary will be looking around the map. Don’t get caught in his beam and use the barriers and snails to hide. Get to the end without being seen to obtain this trophy.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake-Pom-Pom.jpg><ul data-current-count=4707 data-injectable=true><li><strong>“Dehydrated – Silver – Evade all of Pom Pom’s shockwaves during the boss fight.”</strong> During the Prehistoric Kelp Forest boss fight, there will be a few waves where Pom Pom will cause the land to shake, sending shockwaves your way. Try standing at the back of the level to have a bigger gap to avoid them, and don’t worry — you can get hit by enemies and her tears and still earn the trophy.</li><li><strong>“Knight in Shining PJB – Silver – Deliver all cakes without getting hit once.”</strong> During the boss fight for Medieval Sulfur Fields you’ll need to avoid getting hit by any of the Jelly enemies. It is fine if the spells hit you, that should not count for the trophy.</li><li><strong>“Splash Zone – Silver – Have Glovey Glove defeat 20 enemies during the boss fight.”</strong> During the Jelly Glove World boss fight, Glovey will aim to hit you with some goo. Dodge it and let 20 enemies walk through it to get this trophy.</li><li><strong>“Tentacle Dodger – Silver – Don’t get hit by Jelly Squidward’s tentacles during the boss fight.”</strong> During the last boss fight of the game, Jelly Squidward will use his tentacles to attack you. Simply avoid them to earn this trophy. If you stand toward the back of the level it will make it easier for you to dodge his attacks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>“Return to Sender – Bronze – Defeat 5 Jelly Makers by knocking other enemies into them.”</strong> Jelly Makers are the enemies that create smaller Jelly enemies. If you spin attack an enemy you can launch them into the Jelly Maker. Do this to defeat them five times, and achieve this tantalizing trophy.</li><li><strong>“Stunning Performance – Bronze – Push 50 enemies with the Jelly Maker roar.”</strong> When you attack the Jelly Maker it will roar. Simply have enemies standing around it when you do, and they will count toward this trophy.</li><li><strong>“Friendly Fire – Bronze – Defeat a Big Jelly with the Baby Boom projectile.”</strong> Stand behind a Big Jelly while the Baby Boom is attacking you with its missile to score hits on the Big Jelly. You need to defeat the Big Jelly once with this method to earn the trophy.</li><li><strong>“Bubble the Trouble – Bronze – Bubble 10 Tartar Jellies that are currently engaged in an attack.”</strong> The Tartar Jellies are introduced in the Wild West Jellyfish Fields, and they shoot tartar at you. Simply time your bubble to hit them while it is attacking 10 times to get the trophy.</li><li><strong>“Hazardous – Bronze – Defeat 25 Ninjellies with environmental hazards.”</strong> Ninjellies are small and annoying enemies that are introduced in Karate Downtown Bikini Bottom. Simply stand near the edge of platforms that lead to an out-of-bounds area and jump when they attack you. It should roll to defeat, and 25 of these will net you the Bronze Trophy.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Enemies-in-SpongeBob-SquarePants-The-Cosmic-Shake.jpg><ul data-current-count=2110.5 data-injectable=true><li><strong>“Sponge Out of Harm’s Way – Bronze – Defeat 50 enemies without taking damage inflicted by them.”</strong> You need to defeat 50 enemies without getting hit, but it does not have to be 50 consecutive enemies, so you should get this through normal gameplay.</li><li><strong>“Bamboozled – Bronze – Bubble an enemy that hasn’t detected SpongeBob yet.”</strong> To earn this trophy just Bubble someone from a distance before they notice you.</li><li><strong>“SpongeBob JellyPants – Bronze – Carry 10000 Jellies at once.”</strong> Jellies are the main collectible in the game that you get for defeating enemies and destroying Tikis.
